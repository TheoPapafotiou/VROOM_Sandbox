#Markov decision process (MDP)

# finding the best move with -> bayesian optimization 

# step1: path planning -> input
# step2 : navigation .. knownn: static environment 
#          unknown: the behavopr of other road users (MDP)
# step3: motion planning: speed, steering angle, lane-changning...
# step4: vehicle control execute the path 

# we estimate the vehicle state 

# Convolutional neural network (CNN): 
#  filter matrix: input image-> yi = SUM(wi,j*x) + bi
